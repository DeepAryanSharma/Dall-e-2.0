# Dall-E-2.0

Welcome to Dall-E-2.0, an advanced AI image generation tool inspired by MidJourney and DALL-E! This project allows you to create stunning images from textual prompts, utilizing modern web technologies and AI.

## Project Overview

AI image generation tools such as MidJourney and DALL-E have revolutionized the way we create and interact with images, spanning from memes and art to beautiful UI/UX designs. This project showcases the immense potential of these technologies.

## Demonstration

Given that the OpenAI API is now a paid service, we have provided screenshots below to validate the functionality and effectiveness of the Dall-E-2.0 project. These visuals offer a transparent representation of the application's capabilities and its operational status.
